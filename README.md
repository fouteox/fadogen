# Fadogen (Archived)

> **This project is no longer maintained.** I originally created this tool to address a personal need, but it has since been superseded by a more comprehensive solution.

## What's Next?

I've built [Fadogen](https://github.com/fadogen/app), a native macOS application that follows the same philosophy but covers significantly more use cases — from development to production.

Check out the documentation at [docs.fadogen.app](https://docs.fadogen.app) to learn more.
